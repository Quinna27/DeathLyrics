### Exploring Diverse Perspectives on Death in Song Lyrics
Death is a uniquely complex and deeply philosophical topic that many people have habitually avoided to talk about over the years. Based on various culture, times, and personal beliefs, people's understanding of death shows many different perspectives, which is also reflected in the realm of music. 
This project aims to explore diverse ways of expressing death in song lyrics, and how the factors influence the perspectives.

#### Ethical considerations
This project is just for personal study, and it needs to be noted that there are lots of aggressive words in it, especially the words touching on racial topics. These are just the result of topic modelling without any real meaning, and the reason why I don’t stop these words is because they are useful and related to the topic and data analysis.

#### Dataset
The dataset for this project is found on Kaggle[https://data.mendeley.com/datasets/3t9vbwxgr5/3], which has been created for Temporal Analysis and Visualisation of Music. It provides cleaned lyrics data that can be adapted to natural language processing.

#### Techniques
In order to explore the lyrics content, this project will use techniques like Latent Semantic Analysis (LSA) and Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA). 
And for the reason of getting a clear vision of the top word in each topic and find out the connection between topics, WordCloud will be used to display the results. 

#### Results and Discussions
The results and discussions of this project are recorded in the file: Results&Discussions.pdf

#### Conclusion
This project explores diverse perspectives on death in song lyrics, using Topic Modelling techniques LSA and LDA. Comparing two techniques, LSA excels at finding word relationships, while LDA generates narratives around specified terms. The findings also show that there is an increasing trend in discussing death, although it has a bias that death is always identified as a negative word.

#### LLM disclaimer
LLMs is used for LSA and LDA’s code debugging, and the code structure to generate word cloud for visualizing the result of topic modelling.
